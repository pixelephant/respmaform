        <h3>Form</h3>
        <p>It's feels like a bean bag just much easier to get up from it. It's really flexible so you can move around in it but it's always supports your back. It's a playful stylish armchair and if you get tired of enjoying it just a simple zipper move turns it into a bed. Get the sheetings from the fiber drum and have a nap or a good sleep. It is as simple as it can be.</p>
